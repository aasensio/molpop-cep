* Sample run for para H2O
* These lines are echoed in the output because they start with a '*'
*
      Solution method is Slab (Capriotti) escape probability 
      Molecule --- H2O_para
      Number of levels = 45

        Collision information:
    1.  Relative weight of collision partner =  1.00
        Collision rates from data file DataBase/Coll/H2Op_H2.kij

      Tgas =  500.0 K
      n_tot =  5.00E+08 cm-3

      No considerations of dust absorption
      No considerations of Line Overlap
      No maser saturation effects
