      CEP Exact Radiative Transfer Calculation
      Molecule --- CO
      Number of levels = 20

        Collision information:
    1.  Relative weight of collision partner =  3.00
        Collision rates from data file DataBase/Coll/Yang_CO_H2o.kij

    2.  Relative weight of collision partner =  1.00
        Collision rates from data file DataBase/Coll/Yang_CO_H2p.kij

      Tgas =  100.0 K
      n_tot =  1.00E+04 cm-3

      No considerations of dust absorption
      No considerations of Line Overlap
      No maser saturation effects

      External Radiation field includes:
        - 2.725K Cosmic Background
        - Dust with Td =  100.0 K and Tau(v) =  3.00E+00
          Dust properties from file DataBase/Standard_ISM.dat
