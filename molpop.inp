%   This is a sample master input file for MOLPOP
%   This sample is ready to run and should serve to check
%   the first run of the program.
%   Each input file will generate a corresponding output in the 
%   same directory. It can be checked against the output file with
%   the same name in subdireectory OutpuTest

% In these input files, those with extension 'dust' are slab escape
% probability with dust absorption. The input file 
% SLED_nE2_T50no_dust is the same as SLED_nE2_T50slab.
